# Underwater Robot Displacement Tracking 🚀  

This project tracks the **displacement of an underwater robot** relative to a fixed reference point using **Python, OpenCV, and NumPy**. The collected data is used to generate a **Displacement vs Time plot**, which helps analyze the robot’s motion experimentally.  

---

## 📌 Features  
- Tracks robot’s position (yellow marker) relative to reference (black marker)  
- Calculates displacement in **centimeters** using pixel-to-cm calibration  
- Displays live video feed with tracking markers & displacement overlay  
- Provides data for **Displacement vs Time** plotting and motion analysis
